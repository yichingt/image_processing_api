## Project Overview/Structure
The **Image Processing Pipeline API** is a FastAPI-based application that automates the processing of uploaded images. It generates thumbnails, extracts metadata, and uses AI to caption images. The processed results are made available through RESTful API endpoints.

### Key Features:
- **Image Upload**: Accepts image uploads in JPG or PNG formats.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts basic metadata like dimensions, file format, and file size, and store them in memory.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Stores processesed results in memory for quick retrieval.
- **Thumbnail Generator**: Automatically generates small and medium sized thumbnails for each uploaded image.
- **AI-Powered Captioning**: Uses the [Blip Image Captioning by Salesforce](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)

### Process Flow

### API Endpoints
Do refer to this [section](#api-documentation) for the API endpoints documentation.

### Technologies Used:
- **FastAPI**: For building the pipeline API.
- **Uvicorn**: For running the FastAPI server.
- **Pillow**: Used for image processing and thumbnail generation.
- **Transformers**: Used for the AI-powered image captioning.
